## ChipOS Documentation Summary (v2025.11.1)

ChipOS is the "AI Operating System for Hardware Design," a dedicated desktop environment - think macOS for chips - with integrated knowledge management.

**Key "World-Leading" Features:**
1.  **Advanced RAG Engine**: Uses semantic search to understand engineering intent, not just keyword matching.
2.  **Auto-Code Extraction**: Automatically identifies, extracts, and indexes code snippets from documentation to build a searchable library of examples.
3.  **MCP Server**: Acts as a central brain, exposing the knowledge base and project context to external AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf via the Model Context Protocol.
4.  **Knowledge Base**: Crawls websites, indexes PDFs/repos, and organizes hardware knowledge.

**Architecture**:
- **Desktop App**: Dedicated ChipOS desktop app with a macOS-like UX for chip teams.
- **Backend**: "chipos-acf" (Hosted or Local Docker) handles RAG and tasks.
- **Managed Database**: Database backend.

**Core Capabilities**:
- **Semantic Search**: `perform_rag_query` tool.
- **Code Search**: `search_code_examples` tool.
- **Task Management**: Kanban-style tracking with AI assignment.
