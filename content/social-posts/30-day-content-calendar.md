| Day | Platform | Content | Pillar | File Reference |
|-----|----------|---------|--------|----------------|
| Mon | LinkedIn + Instagram | Carousel: "The chip design bottleneck no one talks about" (5-7 slides) | Product Demo | `week-2-posts/mon-bottleneck-carousel.txt` (to create) |
| Tue | LinkedIn | Text post: "What I learned from 3 TPU generations at Intel" | Founder Authority | Draft below |

| Wed | LinkedIn + Instagram | Video/screen recording: ChipOS demo (English → RTL → verification) | Product Demo | Record natively, post as native video |
| Thu | LinkedIn + Instagram | Carousel: competitive landscape (5-7 slides) | Competitive | `competitive-landscape-carousel.md` |
| Fri | LinkedIn | Text: "India joined Pax Silica. Here's why sovereign tools matter" | Thought Leadership | Draft below |
| Fri | Instagram | Carousel: Pax Silica explainer (3-5 slides) | Thought Leadership | Design from Pax Silica content |

### Week 2 Key Drafts

**Tuesday — "What I learned from 3 TPU generations at Intel":**
> I verified silicon for 3 generations of TPU-class AI accelerators at Intel's Habana AI division.
>
> Here's what nobody tells you about chip design:
>
> The actual design — writing RTL, defining architecture — takes 30% of the timeline.
>
> Verification takes 70%.
>
> Finding bugs. Writing testbenches. Running simulations. Debugging waveforms at 2 AM before tapeout deadlines. Doing it again when the spec changes.
>
> With tools whose core architecture was designed when I was born.
>
> I used to think: "Someone should build better tools."
>
> After 10 years, I realized: nobody's building them. Not in India. Not for the agentic era.
>
> So I did.
>
> ChipOS doesn't assist verification. It runs it. AI agents write RTL, generate testbenches, execute verification, debug waveforms, and iterate — autonomously, 24/7.
>
> The question isn't whether AI will transform chip design.
>
> The question is whether India will own that transformation, or outsource it again.

**Friday — "India joined Pax Silica":**
> India just joined Pax Silica — the 11th member of the global semiconductor alliance.
>
> Here's what most coverage missed:
>
> Pax Silica is about securing semiconductor supply chains. Nations coordinating to ensure chip production isn't concentrated in one geography.
>
> But supply chains start with design.
>
> You can't manufacture what you can't design. You can't secure what you don't own. And right now, 100% of India's chip design tools are foreign-built.
>
> Joining Pax Silica is a sovereignty signal. But sovereignty isn't just fabs and foundries. It's the design layer.
>
> That's what ChipOS is building.

- [ ] Competitive landscape carousel gets 30+ saves
- [ ] "Bottleneck" carousel gets shared by at least 2 semiconductor professionals

### Week 3 Key Templates

**Monday — Milestone post:**
> [X] weeks since we launched ChipOS at the India AI Summit.
>
> What we've learned:
>
> 1. The verification bottleneck is universal.
>    Engineers from [list surprising geographies] signed up.
>    Not because of marketing. Because they searched for "AI chip design" and found us.
>
> 2. Institutional interest is real.
>    CDAC. [Other names if available]. Government bodies. Research labs.
>    They're not evaluating hype. They're evaluating feasibility.
>
> 3. Free tier is the moat.
>    [X]% WoW growth. Engineers try it, run a verification cycle,
>    and realize they just saved [X] hours.
>
> 4. The category is moving fast.
>    [Reference any competitor news in the past 2 weeks]
>
> We're building in the open. More updates next week.

**Tuesday — CDAC story:**
> The most surprising question from a CDAC researcher:
>
> [Insert actual question — make it specific and technical]
>
> Why that question matters:
>
> CDAC is building DHRUV64 — India's first domestically designed RISC-V processor.
> The roadmap: DHANUSH64 (quad-core, 1.2 GHz), then DHANUSH64+ (2.0 GHz, 14nm).
>
> Their question wasn't "what is ChipOS?" It was "[specific integration question]."
>
> That's the difference between curiosity and evaluation.
>
> When India's premier computing body asks HOW to integrate your tool, not IF — that's a signal.

**Thursday — Hiring post:**
> Looking for our first verification engineer.
>
> The role: build the verification agents that automate what took me 10 years to learn manually.
>
> What you'll do:
> → Design and implement autonomous verification workflows
> → Work with CDAC's RISC-V team on integration pathways
> → Ship features to [X]+ engineers already using ChipOS
>
> What you bring:
> → SystemVerilog, UVM, or formal verification experience
> → Frustration with current EDA tools (required)
> → Belief that AI should run verification, not just assist it
>
> This is employee #[X]. You'll shape the product, the culture, and the category.
>
> DM me or apply → [link in first comment]
>
> (Even if you're not looking — know someone who is? Tag them.)

### Week 3 Success Metrics

>
> Caption: "Most startups build one product and iterate for 2 years.
> We shipped 9 in 18 months. That velocity is how we found ChipOS —
> and why we can move faster than anyone in this category."

**Tuesday — "Why the next 18 months":**
> Why the next 18 months decide who owns chip design AI:
>
> 1. India's Semiconductor Mission 2.0 just unlocked $4.7B.
>    Government procurement cycles take 12-18 months.
>    Whoever gets embedded in those pipelines NOW gets embedded for a decade.
>
> 2. ChipAgents raised $74M. Chipmind raised $2.5M.
>    Category consensus is forming. In 18 months, the top 3 are set.
>
> 3. The EDA incumbents are awake but slow.
>    Synopsys.ai, Cadence Cerebrus — bolt-ons to 30-year-old architectures.
>    They'll acquire or compete within 18 months.
>
> 4. The talent window.
>    India has 100,000+ chip engineers. The first tool they adopt becomes the standard.
>    That adoption window is NOW.
>
> This isn't a 10-year play. The category defines itself in the next 18 months.

**Friday — Month-in-review:**
