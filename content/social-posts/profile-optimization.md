# Profile Optimization — Do Before Posting

Complete ALL of these before publishing the summit carousel.

---

## LinkedIn (Abhilash Chadhar — Personal Profile)

### Headline
```
Building ChipOS — First Agentic OS for Semiconductor Design | Ex-Intel, ISRO | 9 Intel Awards
```
**Why:** Leads with what you're building (ChipOS), followed by the category claim (first agentic OS), then compressed credibility (Intel, ISRO, awards). VCs scan headlines in search results — this one answers "who is this?" in one line.

**Character count:** ~95 (LinkedIn max: 220)

### Banner Image
**Option A (preferred):** ChipOS branding — dark background (#0a0a0f), ChipOS logo, tagline "The First Agentic OS for Semiconductor Design," website URL (chipos.ai).

**Option B:** India AI Summit launch photo — you on stage or at the event with ChipOS visible. Overlay text: "Launched at India AI Summit 2026."

**Dimensions:** 1584 x 396 px (LinkedIn recommended)

### Featured Section (pin 3 items, in this order)
1. **Summit carousel post** — pin immediately after posting
2. **Press release post** — pin after Friday's post
3. **Demo video** — pin after recording and posting (Week 1 or 2)

**How to pin:** Go to the post > "..." menu > "Feature on top of profile"

### About Section (3 paragraphs)

```
I spent 10 years verifying silicon at Intel (Habana AI), ISRO, and Axelera AI. 9 Intel awards. Multiple tapeouts with working silicon — AI accelerators, RISC-V vector CPUs, PCIe Gen4, USB 3.2 SerDes PHYs.

Verification ate 70% of every project I touched. With EDA tools whose architectures trace back to the 1990s. India has 100,000+ chip engineers. Not one of their design tools was built here.

So I built ChipOS — the first agentic operating system for semiconductor design. Engineers describe intent in plain English. AI agents write the RTL, generate testbenches, run verification, debug waveforms, and iterate autonomously 24/7. CDAC is already exploring it for India's RISC-V processor. Try it free at chipos.ai.
```

**Structure:** Personal story (credibility) → The problem (gap) → The solution (ChipOS + proof + CTA).

**No links in About** except the final chipos.ai mention (LinkedIn doesn't hyperlink URLs in About, but readers will copy-paste).

### Experience Section
Ensure these are listed and current:
- **FutureAtoms** — Founder & CEO (current)
  - Description: "Building ChipOS — the first agentic OS for semiconductor design. 9 AI products shipped in 18 months."
- **Axelera AI** — [Role] (past)
- **Intel (Habana AI)** — [Role] (past)
- **ISRO** — [Role] (past)

### Skills Section
Add/reorder to prioritize:
1. Semiconductor Design
2. Silicon Verification
3. RISC-V
4. AI/Machine Learning
5. SystemVerilog
6. UVM
7. EDA Tools
8. Product Development
9. Startup Leadership

### Activity Settings
- Ensure "Creator Mode" is ON (gives you "Follow" button instead of "Connect")
- Ensure posts are visible to "Anyone" (not just connections)
- Turn ON "Featured" section visibility

## Instagram (@futureatoms)

### Bio
```
First Agentic OS for Chip Design
AI for Semiconductors & Healthcare
Launched at India AI Summit 2026
chipos.ai
```

**Character count:** ~120 (Instagram max: 150)

**Why this works:**
- Line 1: Category claim (what you are)
- Line 2: Scope signal (semiconductors AND healthcare = ambition)
- Line 3: Credibility signal (India AI Summit = institutional context)
- Line 4: URL (direct to chipos.ai, not Linktree)

### Alternative Bio (if using Linktree)
```
First Agentic OS for Chip Design

Launched at India AI Summit 2026
linktr.ee/futureatoms
```

### Link in Bio
Set up Linktree (or similar) with these links in order:
1. **ChipOS** — chipos.ai (top link, always)
2. **Summit Coverage** — futureatoms.com/india-ai-summit-2026
3. **Press Release** — futureatoms.com/press (or direct link to press release page)
4. **Blog** — futureatoms.com/blog
5. **LinkedIn** — linkedin.com/in/abhilashchadhar (cross-pollinate)

### Profile Picture
- Use the same photo across LinkedIn and Instagram for brand consistency
- Professional headshot or photo from summit (presenting)
- High resolution, face clearly visible

### Highlights (create before posting)
Create these highlight covers with consistent design (dark bg, cyan accent, Montserrat font):

1. **"ChipOS"** — Product screenshots, demo clips, feature highlights
2. **"Summit 2026"** — All summit stories, behind-the-scenes, carousel promo
3. **"Team"** — Team photos, hiring announcements, culture
4. **"Product"** — Feature releases, roadmap updates, technical deep-dives

**Highlight cover design:**
- 1080 x 1920 px (story dimensions)
- Background: #0a0a0f
- Center: Icon or text in cyan (#00FFFF)
- Font: Montserrat Bold, 48pt
- Keep it minimal — one word or icon per cover

### Content Grid Strategy
- Alternate between carousel posts and single-image posts for visual variety
- Use consistent color scheme across all posts (dark bg, cyan accents)
- Every 3rd post should be a Reel (video content gets 2x reach)
- No post should look like an ad — educational and value-first always
