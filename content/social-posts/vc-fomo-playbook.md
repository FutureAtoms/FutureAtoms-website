# VC FOMO Playbook — FutureAtoms / ChipOS

## 5 Rotating Narratives

Repeat these in rotation across all content. Every post should reinforce at least one.

### 1. Category Scarcity

**The line:** "Fewer than 10 companies on Earth are building this. $74M already invested in this space. India had zero."

**How to use it:**
- Drop into LinkedIn text posts as context
- Include in carousel slides as a footnote
- Reference when commenting on competitor news
- Use "zero in India" as a refrain

**Variations:**
- "Globally, fewer than 10 companies. In India, one."
- "ChipAgents: $74M. Chipmind: $2.5M. The category is real. India finally has a player."
- "The number of companies building agentic chip design tools you can count on one hand."

### 2. Timing Window

**The line:** "India's Semiconductor Mission 2.0 creates a 3-year window. Who builds the design layer now owns it for 20 years."

**How to use it:**
- Frame every market timing post around this window
- Reference government procurement cycles (12-18 month embedding period)
- Connect to Pax Silica, sovereignty narrative

**Variations:**
- "The next 18 months decide who owns chip design AI."
- "Government pipelines take 12-18 months to embed. The clock started at the summit."
- "Semiconductor Mission 2.0 = $4.7B. The window to become the default design tool is now."

### 3. Competitor Validation

**The line:** "ChipAgents raised $74M in Silicon Valley. The category is being defined NOW."

**How to use it:**
- CELEBRATE competitor raises. Every dollar they raise validates ChipOS.
- Share competitor news with positive framing + ChipOS differentiation
- Use in competitive landscape content

**Variations:**
- "[Competitor] just raised $XM. Great. The category is real."
- "When Silicon Valley puts $74M into your category, that's not competition. That's validation."
- "We're not competing for a market. We're building one. And others are building it too. That's the signal."

### 4. Demand Signal

**The line:** "Enterprise inquiries are outpacing our team size."

**How to use it:**
- Drop into milestone posts and month-in-review content
- Use as hiring justification ("we need to hire because demand is outpacing capacity")
- Reference in VC conversations as social proof

**Variations:**
- "200 semiconductor engineers from 15 countries in 2 weeks."
- "The most common question in my DMs isn't 'what is ChipOS?' It's 'when can we deploy it?'"
- "We haven't done paid marketing. Every signup is organic."

### 5. Velocity Signal

**The line:** Post weekly what was shipped. Execution speed signals founder quality.

**How to use it:**
- Every Friday or Monday: "This week we shipped..."
- Show the cadence: features, fixes, integrations, partnerships
- VCs track execution speed as a proxy for founder quality

**Variations:**
- "This week: [feature 1], [feature 2], [integration]. That's what a team of [X] ships."
- "Week [N] since launch. Shipped: [list]. Broke: [honest admission]. Fixed: [what you did]."
- "9 products in 18 months. ChipOS is product #9. Velocity is the moat."

## Metric Framing Guide

### How to reframe early-stage numbers

| Raw Metric | VC-Ready Framing |
|------------|-----------------|
| 200 users | "200 semiconductor engineers from 15 countries in 2 weeks" |
| Pre-revenue | "Free tier growing 40% WoW; Pro conversion launching Q2" |
| CDAC talked to us | "India's premier computing body exploring ChipOS for their RISC-V processor" |
| Summit launch | "Launched alongside BharatGen, Sarvam AI, and Google at the world's largest AI summit" |
| 9 products | "9 AI products shipped in 18 months — we build fast" |
| Self-funded | "Self-funded to product-market fit; now raising to scale" |
| No revenue | "Deliberate strategy: build adoption first, monetize with Pro/Enterprise tiers in Q2" |
| Small team | "Lean team, outsized output. 261 API routes. 228 tests. 32 MCP tools." |
| No enterprise customers yet | "Enterprise inquiries from [X] companies; deploying proof-of-concept" |
| Limited traction | "Category is pre-market. <10 companies globally. First-mover in India." |

### Framing Rules

1. **Add context to every number.** "200 users" is meaningless. "200 semiconductor engineers from 15 countries in 2 weeks" tells a story.

2. **Use time compression.** "In 2 weeks" makes 200 users impressive. "In 18 months" makes 9 products impressive. Always include the timeframe.

3. **Name the quality.** "Semiconductor engineers" is better than "users." "15 countries" is better than "global." Specificity signals authenticity.

4. **Reframe absence as strategy.** "Pre-revenue" becomes "deliberate strategy." "Self-funded" becomes "capital-efficient to PMF."

5. **Benchmark against category, not absolutes.** "200 users" sounds small against Slack. Against "fewer than 10 companies globally building this" — it's a land grab.

## Social Proof Hierarchy

Present social proof in this order. Each layer amplifies the next.

### 1. Institutional Proof (highest weight)
- CDAC exploring ChipOS for DHRUV64
- Launched at India AI Summit 2026 alongside national AI launches (BharatGen, Sarvam AI)
- Summit platform: 300,000 participants, 100+ countries, 20 heads of state
- Government context: Semiconductor Mission 2.0, Pax Silica membership

**How to use:** Lead with institutional proof. "CDAC is exploring ChipOS" is more powerful than any technical metric.

### 2. Domain Proof
- 10 years at Intel (Habana AI), ISRO, Axelera AI
- 9 Intel awards
- Multiple tapeouts with working silicon (AI accelerators, RISC-V, PCIe Gen4, USB 3.2 SerDes)
- 3 TPU-class generations verified

**How to use:** Compressed credibility. "10 years. Intel. ISRO. 9 awards. Working silicon." — hit all five in one line.

### 3. Technical Proof
- 261 API route handlers
- 228 automated tests (95% pass rate)
- 32 MCP tool registrations
- Multi-provider AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Grok, Ollama)
- Enterprise-grade security (SOC 2 patterns, audit trails)

**How to use:** Technical proof signals "this is real software, not a demo." Use sparingly — only when audience is technical.

### 4. Market Proof
- Category creation: <10 companies globally
- Competitor funding: ChipAgents $74M, Chipmind $2.5M
- Zero Indian companies until ChipOS
- EDA market: $5.6B/quarter, architectures from the 1990s
- India's 100,000+ chip engineers using foreign tools

**How to use:** Market proof answers "is this a real opportunity?" Use in competitive landscape content and timing posts.

### 5. Growth Proof (build over time)
- Signups: number, geographies, growth rate
- Enterprise inquiries: count, quality, stage
- Community: engagement, organic word-of-mouth
- Media: press mentions, industry coverage

**How to use:** Growth proof gets stronger every week. Post milestones consistently. Even small numbers framed well (see metric reframing) signal momentum.

## VC-Ready One-Liners

Keep these in your back pocket. Drop them into captions, comments, and DMs.

| Context | One-Liner |
|---------|-----------|
| What is ChipOS? | "An agentic OS for chip design. Engineers describe intent in English. AI agents design the chip." |
| Why now? | "$250B committed to Indian AI. Zero to the design layer. That's the gap." |
| Why you? | "10 years at Intel/ISRO. 9 awards. Multiple tapeouts. I verified the silicon. Now I'm automating the verification." |
| Competitive moat? | "Full-stack OS, not a point agent. Vendor-neutral, not locked to one model. First in India." |
| Market size? | "$22B EDA market with 30-year-old tools. $300B semiconductor market growing 15% YoY." |
| Traction? | "[X] engineers from [Y] countries. CDAC exploring for India's RISC-V processor." |
| Revenue model? | "Free tier builds adoption. Pro at $29/mo. Enterprise custom. Land-and-expand." |
| What's the ask? | "Raising $5M seed to scale R&D and go-to-market. 40% R&D, 30% GTM, 20% ops, 10% infra." |

## Red Lines (What NOT to Say)

1. **Don't trash competitors.** Celebrate their raises. They validate the space.
2. **Don't overstate CDAC.** "Exploring" is accurate. "Partnership" is not (yet).
3. **Don't claim revenue if pre-revenue.** Frame it as deliberate strategy.
4. **Don't use "disrupt" or "revolutionize."** Use "build" and "create."
5. **Don't compare to ChatGPT/GitHub Copilot.** ChipOS is an OS, not a copilot. The distinction matters.
6. **Don't share confidential CDAC details.** Only share what's publicly known.
7. **Don't inflate signup numbers.** Specific, honest numbers with context > inflated vanity metrics.
8. **Don't say "AI-powered."** Say "agentic." It's more specific and signals sophistication.
