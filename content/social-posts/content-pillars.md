# 7 Content Pillars — FutureAtoms / ChipOS

Every post should map to at least one pillar. The VC signal column tells you *why* this content matters to investors. Rotate through all 7 pillars across each 2-week period.

---

## Pillar 1: Market Timing

**VC Signal:** "Why now" — demonstrates that external conditions create a once-in-a-decade window.

**Core narrative:** India committed $250B to AI infrastructure. Zero went to the design layer. The Semiconductor Mission 2.0 creates a 3-year window. Whoever builds the design layer now owns it for 20 years.

**Example posts:**

1. **LinkedIn text post:**
   > India committed $250B to AI at a single summit. Google: $15B. Microsoft: $17.5B. Adani: $100B.
   >
   > The Semiconductor Mission 2.0 unlocked Rs 40,000 crore ($4.7B) for chips.
   >
   > How much went to the design layer — the tools engineers actually use to create chips?
   >
   > Zero.
   >
   > That's not a gap. That's a category.

2. **Carousel: "Why the next 18 months decide who owns chip design AI"**
   - Slide 1: $250B pledged. Where did it go?
   - Slide 2: Compute: $XXB. Fabs: $XXB. Design tools: $0.
   - Slide 3: India has 100,000+ chip engineers using foreign tools
   - Slide 4: Semiconductor Mission 2.0 = 3-year window
   - Slide 5: Whoever builds the design layer now owns it for 20 years

3. **Commentary post:** React to semiconductor policy news, budget announcements, competitor raises — always connecting back to "the design layer is the missing piece."

**Frequency:** 1-2x per week

## Pillar 2: Founder Authority

**VC Signal:** Domain expertise — this founder knows the problem from the inside.

**Core narrative:** 10 years at Intel (Habana AI), ISRO, Axelera AI. 9 Intel awards. Multiple tapeouts with working silicon. Verification ate 70% of every project. Built the thing that was missing.

**Example posts:**

1. **LinkedIn text post (founder story):**
   > 10 years verifying silicon.
   >
   > Verification ate 70% of every project I touched.
   >
   > India committed Rs 40,000 crore to semiconductors. Zero Indian companies building the design layer.
   >
   > So I built ChipOS.
   >
   > After Intel. After ISRO. After Axelera AI. After 9 Intel awards and multiple tapeouts with working silicon.
   >
   > Not because I wanted to start a company. Because I got tired of waiting for someone else to build what I needed.

2. **Carousel: "What I learned from 3 TPU generations at Intel"**
   - Slide 1: "I verified silicon for 3 TPU generations."
   - Slide 2: What verification actually looks like (day-to-day)
   - Slide 3: The 70% problem (with real examples)
   - Slide 4: Why EDA tools from the 1990s can't solve this
   - Slide 5: "So I built an operating system."

3. **Instagram Reel:** 60-second video: "The chip design problem no one talks about" — Abhilash speaking directly to camera with product visible.

**Frequency:** 1x per week

## Pillar 3: Product Demos

**VC Signal:** It works. This is real software, not a pitch deck.

**Core narrative:** ChipOS is production software. 261 API routes. 228 tests (95% pass rate). 32 MCP tool registrations. Show, don't tell.

**Example posts:**

1. **Screen recording post:**
   - Record: English prompt → pipeline synthesis → RTL output → testbench generation → verification run
   - Caption: "This took 4 hours manually. ChipOS did it in 90 seconds."
   - Post natively on LinkedIn (no YouTube links — LinkedIn penalizes external video)

2. **Carousel: "How ChipOS turns English into silicon"**
   - Slide 1: "Describe a chip in plain English."
   - Slide 2: Layer 1 — Domain IDE (what the engineer sees)
   - Slide 3: Layer 2 — Agent + Model Fabric (what orchestrates)
   - Slide 4: Layer 3 — Knowledge + Policy Layer (what ensures correctness)
   - Slide 5: "Not a copilot. An operating system."

3. **Before/after comparison:**
   - Left: Traditional verification flow (timeline, manual steps, hours)
   - Right: ChipOS flow (prompt, autonomous agents, minutes)
   - Caption: "Same design. Same spec. One took 4 hours. One took 90 seconds."

**Frequency:** 1x per week

## Pillar 4: Traction Signals

**VC Signal:** Demand exists. People want this.

**Core narrative:** Signal momentum without overstating. Use the metric reframing guide (see vc-fomo-playbook.md) to present numbers in their most compelling context.

**Example posts:**

1. **Milestone post:**
   > [X] weeks since launch at the India AI Summit. Here's what happened:
   >
   > → [Y] semiconductor engineers from [Z] countries signed up
   > → CDAC exploring ChipOS for DHRUV64 (India's RISC-V processor)
   > → [N] enterprise inquiries
   > → Free tier growing [X]% week-over-week
   >
   > We're just getting started.

2. **CDAC deep-dive post:**
   > The most surprising question from a CDAC researcher:
   >
   > [Specific technical question about ChipOS integration with RISC-V workflow]
   >
   > Here's why that question matters...
   > [Explain the significance — it means they're evaluating seriously]

3. **Geography post:**
   > "200 semiconductor engineers from 15 countries in 2 weeks."
   >
   > When I launched ChipOS, I expected interest from India.
   > I didn't expect [unexpected country/region].
   >
   > Turns out the verification bottleneck is universal.

**Frequency:** 1x per week (minimum)

   > [Competitor] just raised $[X]M.
   >
   > This is great news.
   >
   > It means the category is real. It means VCs see what we see:
   > chip design needs an OS layer, not more bolt-on copilots.
   >
   > Here's how ChipOS is different: [1-2 sentence differentiation]

3. **EDA incumbents post:**
   > Synopsys: $62.5B market cap. Founded 1986.
   > Cadence: $85B market cap. Founded 1988.
   > Siemens EDA: Part of $140B Siemens.
   >
   > Combined: they serve 90%+ of the chip design market.
   > With architectures from the 1990s.
   >
   > AI doesn't bolt onto 30-year-old tools. It needs a new layer.

**Frequency:** 1x every 2 weeks

## Pillar 7: Thought Leadership

**VC Signal:** Category ownership. This founder IS the category.

**Core narrative:** Comment on semiconductor policy, EDA market dynamics, AI hardware trends. Always bring it back to the design layer thesis. Become the go-to voice on "AI for chip design" in India.

**Example posts:**

1. **Policy commentary:**
   > India just joined Pax Silica — the global semiconductor alliance.
   >
   > Here's what most people missed:
   > Pax Silica is about securing the semiconductor supply chain.
   > But supply chains start with design.
   >
   > You can't secure what you can't build.
   > And you can't build what you can't design.
   >
   > The design layer is the foundation. Everything else is downstream.

2. **Industry analysis:**
   > The EDA market is $5.6B per quarter.
   > Growing 14% YoY. Record revenue for Synopsys and Cadence.
   >
   > But here's the thing: their growth is coming from
   > increasingly complex designs that NEED more tooling.
   >
   > That's not sustainable. AI-native tools aren't coming.
   > They're here.

3. **Repost + commentary:** Share articles about semiconductor policy, chip shortage, AI hardware demand. Add 2-3 paragraphs of original commentary. Tag original author.

**Frequency:** 2-3x per week (quick, reactive posts)
