## Action 4: Record a 60-Second Video

**Time:** 30 minutes recording + 15 minutes editing
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH — video content gets 2x reach
**No file reference — record fresh**

### Steps:
1. [ ] Script (60 seconds, speak naturally — don't read):
   ```
   Key points to hit:
   - "I'm Abhilash. I spent 10 years verifying silicon at Intel, ISRO, Axelera AI."
   - "Verification eats 70% of every chip project."
   - "Every design tool in India is foreign-built."
   - "I built ChipOS — an agentic OS where you describe a chip in English
     and AI agents design it autonomously."
   - "CDAC is already exploring it for India's RISC-V processor."
   - "Try it free at chipos.ai."
   ```

2. [ ] Recording setup:
   - Good lighting (natural light or ring light)
   - Clean background (or ChipOS on screen behind you)
   - Phone in portrait mode (9:16 for Reels, 16:9 for LinkedIn)
   - Record BOTH orientations if possible
   - Look at camera, not screen
   - Speak conversationally, not like a pitch

3. [ ] Edit:
   - Add captions/subtitles (80% of LinkedIn video is watched muted)
   - Add "chipos.ai" text overlay at the end
   - Keep it under 90 seconds
   - No fancy transitions — authenticity > production value

4. [ ] Post as:
   - LinkedIn native video (NOT YouTube link)
   - Instagram Reel (portrait orientation)
   - Add to Instagram "ChipOS" highlight

**Done when:** Video recorded, edited, posted on LinkedIn + Instagram.

### Steps:
1. [ ] Verify competitor data is current:
   - ChipAgents: funding amount, stage, focus
   - Chipmind: funding amount, stage, focus
   - Maieutic: funding amount, stage, focus
   - Synopsys/Cadence/Siemens: market caps, AI initiatives

2. [ ] Design 7 slides following `competitive-landscape-carousel.md`:

   - Slide 2: Incumbents (Synopsys, Cadence, Siemens EDA)
   - Slide 3: ChipAgents ($74M, Silicon Valley)
   - Slide 4: Chipmind ($2.5M) + Maieutic ($6M)
   - Slide 5: 2x2 positioning map (scope vs. openness)
   - Slide 6: ChipOS profile
   - Slide 7: Thesis — "In India: Zero. Until now."

3. [ ] Draft LinkedIn caption (from `competitive-landscape-carousel.md`)
