ENHANCED CAROUSEL — VC-SIGNAL EDITION
======================================================

10-SLIDE CAROUSEL: ChipOS as narrative climax
LinkedIn + Instagram — same slides, different captions.

KEY CHANGE FROM ORIGINAL:
  The original had ChipOS as item #4 in a list (Slide 4).
  This version makes ChipOS the NARRATIVE CLIMAX (Slides 7-8).
  VCs remember the climax. A list item is forgettable.
  A reveal is memorable.

STRUCTURE:
  Slides 1-4:  Summit scale ($200B, Guinness, Modi, Big Tech)
  Slides 5-6:  "Then came Day 3..." tension + 5 breakthroughs
  Slides 7-8:  ChipOS reveal + what it does (the payoff)
  Slide 9:     CDAC validation + Day 4-5 recap
  Slide 10:    Thesis + CTA

NEW RULE: Every single slide has a BOLD NUMBER.
  VCs process numbers faster than text. Every slide anchors on
  a number that signals scale, speed, or scarcity.

      "GUINNESS WORLD RECORD." white 40pt.
      "I WAS THERE." white 36pt bold.

Bold number: $250B (signals: massive market, India going all-in)

Why it stops the scroll:
  - $250B is a larger, more accurate number than $200B
    (total commitments including Reliance/Jio ~$110B)
  - "300,000 participants" = social proof of importance
  - "I was there" = founder credibility, personal
  - Three jaw-drop facts before asking for a swipe

Font: "58,000" cyan 70pt. "BUT WHAT ABOUT THE DESIGN LAYER?"
      white 36pt bold italic — the open loop.

Bold number: 58,000 (signals: India is serious about infra)

Why this slide is new:
  - The original jumped from money to Day 3. This slide asks
    the question a VC would ask: where's the design layer?
  - "But what about the design layer?" = the gap. This is the
    setup for ChipOS. VCs are now primed to look for it.

|   THEN CAME DAY 3.                       |
|                                           |
|   5 ANNOUNCEMENTS.                       |
|   ONE DAY.                               |
|   EVERYTHING CHANGED.                    |

+-------------------------------------------+

Font: "THEN CAME DAY 3." white 60pt bold.
      "5" cyan 80pt. "EVERYTHING CHANGED." white 40pt.

Bold number: 5 (signals: density of breakthroughs)

Why it works:
  - Open loop: what were the 5 announcements? Must swipe.
  - "Everything changed" adds stakes
  - Short (10 words). Photo does the heavy lifting.
  - Zeigarnik Effect: incomplete information the brain resolves

|   4. CHIPOS LAUNCHED.                    |
|      (I'LL EXPLAIN.)                     |
|                                           |
|   5. CDAC NOTICED.                       |

|                                           |
|                                    5/10  |
+-------------------------------------------+

Font: Numbers in cyan circles. "500,000+" cyan bold.
      "(I'LL EXPLAIN.)" italic — the tease.
      "(THAT PART SURPRISED ME.)" italic — human, not corporate.

Bold number: 500,000+ (signals: massive attention on this day)

Key change from original:
  - Item 4 says "(I'll explain.)" instead of "(More on that in
    a second)" — more personal, builds anticipation
  - Item 5 says "(That part surprised me.)" — adds emotional
    authenticity that VCs respond to
  - ChipOS is still discovered, not pitched. But now items 4-5
    create a DOUBLE open loop that makes slides 7-8 feel
    like a reward for swiping

Font: "70%" cyan 80pt bold — the anchor number.
      "ZERO" cyan 60pt. "INTEL. ISRO." cyan 36pt.
      "FOREIGN-BUILT." white 44pt bold.

Bold number: 70% (signals: massive inefficiency = massive opportunity)

Why this slide is restructured:
  - Original combined the gap + reveal in one slide ("So I built one")
  - Separating them creates MORE tension. Slide 6 is the problem.
    Slide 7 is the solution. The payoff is amplified.
  - "70%" gives VCs an anchor: "If verification is 70% and it's
    still done manually, that's a billion-dollar efficiency gain."
  - "9 awards. Working silicon." = compressed credibility
  - "Zero Indian companies" = the scarcity signal VCs love

Font: "SO I BUILT ONE." white 60pt bold — the payoff.
      "CHIPOS" cyan 80pt bold.
      "261" cyan 50pt.
      "NOT A COPILOT. AN OPERATING SYSTEM." white 36pt bold.

Bold number: 261 (signals: this is real, shipped software)

Why this is now the climax:
  - "So I built one." — four words that resolve 6 slides of tension
  - Technical metrics (261 routes, 228 tests, 32 tools) signal
    to VCs that this isn't a demo. It's production software.
  - "Enterprise-ready" is a VC keyword
  - The original had ChipOS on slides 5-6 (mid-carousel). Now it's
    on slide 7 — the natural climax of a 10-slide arc.

      "CDAC" and "RISC-V" in cyan.

Bold number: <10 (signals: category scarcity, first-mover advantage)

Why this slide combines CDAC + competitive context:
  - Original had CDAC on its own slide. Adding competitive
    context makes the validation slide do double duty:
    1. Institutional proof (CDAC)
    2. Category validation ($74M in competitor funding)
    3. Scarcity signal (<10 companies globally)
  - "In India: Zero. Until now." is the money line for VCs.
    It answers: "Is there anyone else doing this?"

      "$0" white 60pt bold — the contrast.
      "INDIA IS BUILDING IT." white 40pt bold.

Bold number: $200B+ (signals: massive market being created)

Why this slide combines Day 4-5 + thesis:
  - Original had Day 4-5 and thesis as separate slides
  - Combining them creates room for a stronger CTA on slide 10
  - "$250B for compute. $0 for the design layer." = the
    single-sentence investment thesis that makes VCs lean in
  - This is the "why now" slide that every VC deck needs

      "SAVE THIS POST" white 32pt bold.

Bold number: Free (signals: accessible, try-before-you-buy)

Changes from original:
  - Added engagement question to the slide itself (not just caption)
  - "17 articles" adds a number to the summit coverage CTA
  - Explicit "save this post" ask = algorithm gold
  - The question invites comments, boosting reach

THE ENHANCED SWIPE EXPERIENCE
=====================================================================

  1:  "$250B summit. 300K people. Guinness Record. I was there."
       |
  2:  "Modi opened it. Adani $100B. Big Tech $50B+. Insane."
       |
  3:  "58K GPUs, fabs, infra... but what about the design layer?"
       |
  4:  "Day 3 had 5 announcements. What were they?"
       |
  5:  "Semiconductor Mission, Micron, AI legends, he launched
       something, CDAC noticed... tell me more"
       |
  6:  "10 years at Intel. 70% is verification. Zero Indian tools."
       |
  7:  "He built ChipOS. 261 APIs. Not a copilot. An OS."    <-- CLIMAX
       |
  8:  "CDAC is exploring it. <10 companies globally. $74M invested.
       India had zero."
       |
  9:  "$250B for compute. $0 for design. India is building."
       |
  10: "Let me try it free. And save this."

Emotional arc:
  Awe > Scale > Question > Curiosity > Discovery > Problem >
  Solution (CLIMAX) > Validation > Thesis > Action

BOLD NUMBER SUMMARY (VC QUICK-SCAN)
=====================================================================

  Slide 1:  $250B    — Market scale
  Slide 2:  $100B    — Corporate conviction
  Slide 3:  58,000   — Infrastructure scale
  Slide 4:  5        — Density of breakthroughs
  Slide 5:  500,000+ — Attention/eyeballs
  Slide 6:  70%      — Problem size (= opportunity size)
  Slide 7:  261      — Product maturity (shipped, not vaporware)
  Slide 8:  <10      — Category scarcity
  Slide 9:  $200B+   — Market being created
  Slide 10: Free     — Accessibility

A VC scanning ONLY the bold numbers gets:
  "$250B... $100B... 58K GPUs... 5 breakthroughs... 500K viewers...
   70% bottleneck... 261 APIs... <10 companies... $200B market... Free"

That sequence alone tells the investment story.

KEY DIFFERENCES FROM ORIGINAL
=====================================================================

1. CHIPOS IS NOW THE CLIMAX (Slide 7), not item #4 in a list
   - Original: discovered on Slide 4 as list item
   - Enhanced: revealed on Slide 7 as narrative payoff
   - Why: VCs remember the climax, not the middle

2. EVERY SLIDE HAS A BOLD NUMBER
   - Original: some slides were text-only
   - Enhanced: 10 bold numbers that tell the story alone
   - Why: VCs scan before they read

3. THE GAP IS ASKED BEFORE IT'S ANSWERED
   - New Slide 3: "But what about the design layer?"
   - Slide 6: "Zero Indian companies building the design layer"
   - Slide 7: "So I built one."
   - Why: Problem-solution arc is the VC narrative structure

4. COMPETITIVE CONTEXT ADDED (Slide 8)
   - Original: CDAC alone
   - Enhanced: CDAC + "<10 companies" + "$74M invested"
   - Why: Category validation is the #1 thing VCs look for

5. THESIS IS SHARPER (Slide 9)
   - Original: "India isn't just consuming AI. India is building it."
   - Enhanced: "$250B for compute. $0 for the design layer."
   - Why: The contrast makes the opportunity undeniable

6. CTA HAS ENGAGEMENT HOOK (Slide 10)
   - Original: just links
   - Enhanced: question + save ask + links
   - Why: Comments and saves boost algorithmic reach
