$250 billion committed. 300,000 people. Guinness World Record. One thing missing.

The India AI Impact Summit 2026 just wrapped. The slides above tell the story day by day — swipe through.

What the slides couldn't fit:

The Hassabis-Bengio-LeCun joint keynote had 500,000+ concurrent viewers. Three people who've disagreed about AGI for decades — on one stage, in New Delhi.

Micron's Gujarat plant began producing India's first commercial chips. That sentence didn't exist 12 months ago.

And on Day 3, between Semiconductor Mission 2.0 and the AI godfathers keynote, I launched ChipOS.

10 years of verification at Intel, ISRO, Axelera AI. 9 awards. Working silicon. Verification eats 70% of every chip project — with tools from the 1990s. $250B committed to compute. Zero to the design layer.

ChipOS: describe a chip in plain English. AI agents write RTL, run verification, debug waveforms, iterate 24/7. Not a copilot. An operating system.

CDAC — behind India's RISC-V processor — is already exploring it.

Fewer than 10 companies on Earth are building this. $74M already invested in this category. India had zero. Until now.
