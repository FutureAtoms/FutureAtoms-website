I just spent 5 days at the India AI Impact Summit 2026.

There's a lot of noise about crowds and access. That happens at any event with 3,250+ speakers from 100+ countries. Here's what I'm taking away — the signal.

Day 1-2 were about the money:
→ Adani: $100B committed to AI data centers (largest single corporate pledge at any summit)
→ Google: $15B. Microsoft: $20B. Amazon: $16B.
→ Total by Day 2: $150B+

Day 3 was when things shifted from pledges to proof:
→ India launched Semiconductor Mission 2.0 — ₹40,000 crore ($4.7B)
→ Micron's Sanand, Gujarat facility began commercial chip production — India's first
→ Hassabis, Bengio, and LeCun delivered a joint keynote to 500,000+ live viewers
→ And between those announcements, I launched ChipOS

I've spent 10 years in silicon verification. Intel (Habana AI division). ISRO. Axelera AI. 9 Intel awards. Multiple tapeouts with working silicon — AI accelerators, RISC-V vector CPUs, PCIe Gen4, USB 3.2 SerDes PHYs.

I watched verification eat 70% of every project I touched. With EDA tools whose architectures trace back to the 1990s. Built by Synopsys, Cadence, Siemens — all American or European. India has 100,000+ chip engineers. Not one of their design tools was built here.

ChipOS is an agentic operating system for semiconductor design. Engineers describe intent in plain English. AI agents write the RTL, generate testbenches, run verification, debug waveforms, and iterate autonomously 24/7. Not a copilot. An OS.

Globally, fewer than 10 companies are building this. ChipAgents (Silicon Valley, $74M). Chipmind (Zurich, $2.5M). The EDA incumbents bolting AI onto 30-year-old architectures. In India — zero, until now.

Within hours of launch, CDAC — the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, the team behind India's first domestically designed RISC-V processor (DHRUV64) — started exploring ChipOS for their next iterations.

Day 4-5 closed the loop:
→ PM Modi opened the Leaders' Plenary
→ Altman, Pichai, and Macron sat at one roundtable
→ India scaled from 38,000 to 58,000 GPUs
→ Google and Jio partnered on cloud AI clusters for 450M+ users
→ The summit set a Guinness World Record: $200B+ in investment pledges

You cannot design chips faster with tools from the 1990s. ChipOS is the missing layer.
