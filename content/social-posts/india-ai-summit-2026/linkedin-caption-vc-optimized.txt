At a $250 billion summit, I noticed what was missing.

The India AI Impact Summit 2026 just ended at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi. 300,000 participants. 3,250+ speakers. 100+ countries. A Guinness World Record for investment pledges.

The slides above break it down day by day. Here's the context they couldn't fit:

Day 1-2 were about the money. Adani committed $100B to AI data centers — the largest single corporate pledge in AI history. Google ($15B), Microsoft ($17.5B India + $50B Global South), Amazon ($16B), OpenAI + Tata (multi-billion HyperVault). By end of Day 2: $150B+ committed to Indian AI infrastructure.

Then Day 3 happened.

India launched Semiconductor Mission 2.0 — Rs 40,000 crore ($4.7B). Micron's Gujarat facility began producing India's first commercial chips. Hassabis, Bengio, and LeCun delivered a joint keynote to 500,000+ live viewers. Three people who've spent careers disagreeing about AGI — on one stage, in New Delhi.

And between those announcements, I launched ChipOS.

I've spent 10 years in silicon verification. Intel (Habana AI division). ISRO. Axelera AI. 9 Intel awards. Multiple tapeouts with working silicon — AI accelerators, RISC-V vector CPUs, PCIe Gen4, USB 3.2 SerDes PHYs.

Verification eats 70% of every chip project. The EDA tools running that verification? Their architectures trace back to the 1990s. Built by Synopsys, Cadence, Siemens — all American or European.

India committed $250B to AI.

Zero went to the design layer.

Zero Indian companies were building that layer.

ChipOS is an agentic operating system for semiconductor design. Engineers describe intent in plain English. AI agents write the RTL, generate testbenches, run verification, debug waveforms, and iterate autonomously 24/7. 261 API routes. 228 tests. 32 MCP tools. Enterprise-grade security.

Not a copilot. An operating system.

Globally, fewer than 10 companies are building this. ChipAgents raised $74M in Silicon Valley. Chipmind raised $2.5M in Zurich. The category is being defined right now.

Within hours of launch, CDAC — the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, the team behind India's first domestically designed RISC-V processor (DHRUV64) — started exploring ChipOS for their next iterations.

Day 4-5 closed the loop: Modi opened the Leaders' Plenary. Altman, Pichai, and Macron sat at one roundtable. India joined Pax Silica. The Guinness Record was certified: $200B+ in commitments.

$250B for compute. $0 for the design layer.

That's the gap. That's what I'm building for.

What do you think India's semiconductor industry needs most right now?

POSTING NOTES:
=======================================================================

1. HOOK: "At a $250 billion summit, I noticed what was missing."
   - This is designed to stop the scroll and get the "see more" click
   - It's a pattern interrupt: everyone is posting summit highlights,
     you're posting about what's MISSING

2. NO EXTERNAL LINKS in the caption body
   - LinkedIn suppresses posts with external links by 40-50%
   - All links (chipos.ai, futureatoms.com) go in FIRST COMMENT
   - Post the first comment within 30 seconds of publishing

3. ENGAGEMENT QUESTION at the end
   - "What do you think India's semiconductor industry needs most?"
   - Open-ended, invites discussion, signals thought leadership
   - Reply to EVERY comment in the first 2 hours (algorithm boost)

4. HASHTAGS
   - 5 hashtags at the bottom, after the divider line
   - Mix of event (#IndiaAISummit2026), industry (#Semiconductors,
     #ChipDesign), and movement (#AgenticAI, #BuildInPublic)
   - No #AI (too broad, dilutes reach)

5. POSTING TIME
   - Ideal: Tuesday-Thursday 8-10 AM IST (India VCs are active)
   - Alternative: 6:30 PM IST (overlaps with US West Coast morning)
   - Avoid Monday (post-weekend low engagement) and Friday (wind-down)

6. TAG these people/companies in the post:
   - @CDAC India (if they have a LinkedIn page)
   - @India AI (official summit page)
   - Do NOT tag competitors (ChipAgents, Chipmind)
   - Do NOT tag Modi/Google/Microsoft (seems needy)

7. AFTER POSTING:
   - Immediately post the first comment with links
   - Spend 30 minutes engaging on posts by target VCs and
     semiconductor leaders
   - Monitor profile views — spikes = VC interest
   - Track saves/shares (saves = highest quality signal)
