The India AI Impact Summit 2026 just wrapped at Bharat Mandapam.

There's been a lot of noise about crowds and logistics. That happens when 3,250+ speakers from 100+ countries show up. Here's the signal — day by day in the slides above.

A few things the slides didn't have room for:

The Hassabis-Bengio-LeCun joint keynote had 500,000+ concurrent viewers. Standing room only. Three people who've spent their careers disagreeing about AGI — on one stage, in New Delhi.

Micron's Gujarat plant didn't just "begin production." It's India's first commercial semiconductor facility. That's a sentence that didn't exist 12 months ago.

And on Day 3, between Semiconductor Mission 2.0 and the AI godfathers keynote, I walked on stage and launched ChipOS — an agentic OS where engineers describe chip designs in plain English and AI agents write the RTL, run verification, debug waveforms, and iterate 24/7.

I built it after 10 years of doing verification the old way. At Intel (Habana AI). At ISRO. At Axelera AI. With tools from the 1990s.

CDAC — the team behind India's DHRUV64 RISC-V processor — is already exploring it.
