PHOTO ORDER STRATEGY — 6-Picture Carousel
==========================================

The order matters more than the captions. Each photo should tell the story visually.

Slide 1 — HOOK
  Photo: You at Bharat Mandapam (exterior) — the iconic shot
  Purpose: Establishes "I was there" credibility. This is the thumbnail people see first.

Slide 2 — SCALE
  Photo: Inside the summit — crowd/stage/scale shot
  Purpose: Shows the magnitude (3,250+ speakers, 100+ countries)

Slide 3 — AUTHORITY
  Photo: You presenting / on stage (photo 1)
  Purpose: You weren't just attending, you were presenting

Slide 4 — PRODUCT
  Photo: You presenting / on stage (photo 2 — different angle or moment)
  Purpose: The ChipOS moment

Slide 5 — ENERGY
  Photo: Interesting summit moment — panel, expo, networking
  Purpose: The vibe, the people, the momentum

Slide 6 — CTA
  Photo: You + ChipOS branding or a strong closing shot
  Purpose: The memorable final image


VISUAL ARC (even if nobody reads a word):
  Landmark → Scale → Presenting → Presenting → Energy → Close
