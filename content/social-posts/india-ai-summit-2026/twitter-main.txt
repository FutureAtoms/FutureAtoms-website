India AI Summit 2026 — the signal, not the noise:

Day 1-2: Adani $100B. Google + Microsoft + Amazon $50B+.
Day 3: Semiconductor Mission 2.0 ($4.7B). Micron Gujarat goes commercial. Hassabis + Bengio + LeCun keynote.
Day 4: Modi. Altman. Pichai. One table. 58,000 GPUs.
Day 5: $200B+ total. Guinness World Record.

On Day 3, I launched ChipOS — an AI OS for chip design. Describe a chip in English. Agents build it.

10 years at Intel/ISRO/Axelera taught me: you can't design chips faster with tools from the '90s.

CDAC is already exploring it for India's RISC-V processor.
