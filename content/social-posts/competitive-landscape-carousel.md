# Competitive Landscape Carousel — "Who's Building AI for Chip Design?"

**Pillar:** Competitive Landscape
**VC Signal:** Category exists. Smart money is validating the space.
**When to post:** Week 2, Thursday

This is the single highest-impact content piece for VC signal. A competitive landscape carousel does three things simultaneously:
1. Validates the category (others are building this = real market)
2. Shows your awareness (you know the space = domain expertise)
3. Positions ChipOS (full-stack, vendor-neutral, India-first)

## SLIDE 2 — THE INCUMBENTS

```
+-------------------------------------------+
|  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  |
|                                           |
|   THE INCUMBENTS                         |
|                                           |
|   SYNOPSYS     $62.5B MARKET CAP         |
|   Founded 1986. AI bolt-on: Synopsys.ai  |
|                                           |
|   CADENCE      $85B MARKET CAP           |
|   Founded 1988. AI bolt-on: Cerebrus     |
|                                           |

|                                           |
|   COMBINED: 90%+ OF CHIP DESIGN MARKET   |
|   ARCHITECTURE: 1990s                    |
|                                           |
|                                    2/7   |
+-------------------------------------------+
```

**Key framing:** These are the giants. They've dominated for 40 years. But their core architectures are from the 1990s. They're adding AI as bolt-ons, not building AI-native tools.

Font: Market caps in cyan. "1990s" in cyan for emphasis.

## SLIDE 3 — CHIPAGENTS (Silicon Valley)

```
+-------------------------------------------+
|  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  |
|                                           |
|   CHIPAGENTS                             |
|   Silicon Valley                         |
|                                           |
|   RAISED: $74M                           |
|   FOCUS: AI agents for chip design       |
|   STAGE: Series A / B                    |
|                                           |
|   THE SIGNAL:                            |
|   When Silicon Valley puts $74M into     |
|   your category, the market is real.     |
|                                           |
|                                    3/7   |
+-------------------------------------------+
```

**Key framing:** Celebrate the raise. "$74M" validates the category. Do NOT trash them.

Font: "$74M" cyan 70pt.

## SLIDE 4 — CHIPMIND (Zurich)

```
+-------------------------------------------+
|  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  |
|                                           |
|   CHIPMIND                               |

|   RAISED: $2.5M                          |

|                                           |
|   RAISED: $6M                            |

|                                    4/7   |
+-------------------------------------------+
```

**Key framing:** More players = category consensus. Maieutic shows India has adjacent activity but is analog-only (different segment).

Font: Funding amounts in cyan.

## SLIDE 5 — THE POSITIONING MAP

```
+-------------------------------------------+
|  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  |
|                                           |
|   SCOPE                                  |
|   ^                                      |

|                                           |
|                                    5/7   |
+-------------------------------------------+
```

**Key framing:** The 2x2 grid is the VC's favorite framework. It answers instantly: "Where does ChipOS sit?" Top-left = Full-stack + Vendor-neutral. That's the defensible quadrant.

**Design notes:**
- ChipOS dot: cyan with glow/pulse animation (if animated) or larger circle
- Competitor dots: white, smaller
- Axes: white lines with cyan labels
- Grid background: subtle grid lines at 20% opacity

## SLIDE 6 — CHIPOS

|                                    6/7   |
+-------------------------------------------+
```

**Key framing:** ChipOS gets its own slide AFTER the competitors. This order matters:
1. Show the incumbents (establishes the $200B+ market)
2. Show the startups (establishes the category + VC interest)
3. Show ChipOS (the punchline: "and here's the Indian one")

Font: "FIRST AND ONLY IN INDIA." white 36pt bold. "CDAC" in cyan.

**Key framing:** End with the scarcity signal. This slide is designed to be screenshotted by VCs.

Who's building AI for chip design?

The EDA market is $5.6B per quarter. Dominated by Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens EDA — with architectures from the 1990s.

A new category is emerging: agentic AI for chip design. Not copilots that suggest code. Operating systems where AI agents design chips autonomously.

ChipAgents raised $74M in Silicon Valley. Chipmind raised $2.5M in Zurich. Maieutic raised $6M in India for analog design.

Globally, fewer than 10 companies are building this.

In India, zero were building the full-stack digital design layer. Until we launched ChipOS at the India AI Summit.

The category is being defined right now. Save this for reference.

## Why This Is the Highest-Impact Piece

1. **VCs share competitive landscapes.** It's the format they use internally. When you create one publicly, they screenshot and forward it.

2. **It validates the category better than any product demo.** "$74M invested" is more convincing than any feature list.

3. **It positions ChipOS without pitching.** By presenting the full landscape fairly, you look like the expert, not the salesperson.

4. **The "who am I missing?" question generates comments.** Every comment boosts reach. And the answers give you competitive intelligence for free.

5. **It's evergreen.** Update it quarterly as the landscape evolves. It becomes YOUR framework that the industry references.
