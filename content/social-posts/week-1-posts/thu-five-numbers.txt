5 numbers from the India AI Summit 2026. And one more.

$250B — total investment pledges. Guinness World Record.

58,000 — GPUs India will have by year-end (up from 38,000).

$4.7B — India's Semiconductor Mission 2.0 budget (Rs 40,000 crore).

500,000+ — concurrent viewers for the Hassabis-Bengio-LeCun keynote.

100,000+ — chip engineers in India right now.

And the number that matters most:

0 — Indian companies building the design layer. The tools those 100,000 engineers use every day to create chips.

$250B for compute. $4.7B for semiconductors. $0 for the design layer.

That's not a gap. That's a category.

Design a single image (1080 x 1350) with:
- Dark background (#0a0a0f)
- India tricolor accent line at top
- Title: "5 NUMBERS FROM THE SUMMIT. AND ONE MORE."
- Each number in cyan, 60pt, left-aligned
- Description in white, 28pt
- "0" as the final number, isolated, larger (80pt)
- "$250B for compute. $0 for design." at bottom in white 32pt

Swipe through the carousel for the full day-by-day breakdown (3 posts back).

The number that matters most: 0 Indian companies building the chip design layer.

$250B for compute. $0 for design.

That's the gap. That's what we're building.

POSTING NOTES:
=====================================================================

1. THIS IS A "SAVE-WORTHY" POST
   - Data posts with clean numbers get high save rates
   - The "5 + 1" structure is a proven engagement format
   - The "zero" reveal at the end creates the emotional punch

2. THE ZERO IS THE INVESTMENT THESIS
   - VCs scanning this post will immediately see the opportunity
   - $250B committed, 100K engineers, zero tools = obvious gap
   - This is the "why now" distilled to one number

3. STRUCTURE:
   - 5 impressive numbers (each a jaw-dropper on its own)
   - Build false pattern: "it's all going up"
   - Break with "0" — the contrast creates the insight
   - Thesis line: "$250B for compute. $0 for design."

4. POSTING TIME: Thursday 8-10 AM IST
