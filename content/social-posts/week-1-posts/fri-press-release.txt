We have a formal announcement.

On February 18, 2026, at the India AI Impact Summit — the world's largest AI summit with 300,000 participants and $250B+ in investment pledges — FutureAtoms launched ChipOS.

ChipOS is the first agentic operating system for semiconductor design built in India.

What it does:
Engineers describe chip designs in plain English. AI agents autonomously write RTL, generate testbenches, run verification, debug waveforms, and iterate — 24/7.

3-layer architecture:
1. Domain IDE — RTL, verification, physical design workspace
2. Agent + Model Fabric — multi-provider AI routing + workflow orchestration
3. Knowledge + Policy Layer — private RAG, auditable actions, compliance

What's live today:
261 API routes. 228 automated tests. 32 MCP tool registrations. Multi-provider AI (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Grok, Ollama). Enterprise-grade security.

What happened within hours:
CDAC — the Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, behind India's DHRUV64 RISC-V processor — began exploring ChipOS for their next-generation designs.

The context:
Globally, fewer than 10 companies are building agentic chip design tools. $74M+ has been invested in this category. In India: zero companies, until now.

Pricing: Free tier (50 queries/day). Pro ($29/month). Enterprise (custom, on-premise, air-gapped).

This is Day 1.

POSTING NOTES:
=====================================================================

1. FORMAT: This is intentionally more formal than the other posts
   - Press release tone signals "this is official, this is real"
   - The contrast with personal/narrative posts earlier in the week
     shows range: founder who can do personal AND professional
   - Structured sections make it easy for journalists to screenshot/quote

2. NO HASHTAGS (formal announcement tone)

3. "We have a formal announcement." — This opening stops the scroll
   because it's unusual. Most LinkedIn posts start with stories or
   questions. A direct announcement is pattern-breaking.

4. THE TECHNICAL METRICS MATTER HERE
   - In narrative posts (Tue), we avoided technical details
   - In the announcement, metrics (261 routes, 228 tests, 32 tools)
     signal that this is production software, not a concept
   - VCs and technical evaluators will screenshot these numbers

5. PRICING INCLUDED
   - Including pricing in an announcement signals confidence
   - Free tier = low barrier, high adoption potential
   - $29 Pro = real business model
   - Enterprise = revenue upside

6. "This is Day 1." — The close signals: there's a lot more coming.
   Creates FOMO: if you're not paying attention now, you'll miss the ride.

7. ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:
   - This post is designed to be SHARED, not just liked
   - Ask team members and supporters to share (not just like)
   - Respond to every comment with specific, thoughtful replies
   - If journalists or VCs comment, prioritize those replies

8. POSTING TIME: Friday 9 AM IST
   - Friday posts have lower engagement BUT announcements are an exception
   - People share formal announcements over the weekend
   - Monday morning, people return to see it in their feed
