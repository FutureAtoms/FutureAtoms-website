TUESDAY — FOUNDER STORY (LinkedIn text-only post)
=====================================================================
Pillar: Founder Authority
VC Signal: Domain expertise — this founder knows the problem from inside

10 years verifying silicon.

Verification ate 70% of every project I touched.

At Intel's Habana AI division — verifying AI accelerators across 3 TPU-class generations.
At ISRO — where failure isn't a KPI discussion, it's a national headline.
At Axelera AI — pushing edge AI silicon to tapeout.

9 Intel awards. Multiple tapeouts with working silicon. RISC-V vector CPUs. PCIe Gen4. USB 3.2 SerDes PHYs.

Every single one of those projects ran on the same EDA tools. Tools whose core architectures were designed in the 1990s. Built by three American and European companies.

India committed Rs 40,000 crore to semiconductors last week.

India has 100,000+ chip engineers.

Zero Indian companies were building the design layer.

So I built ChipOS.

Not another copilot that suggests code. An operating system where AI agents write RTL, generate testbenches, run verification, debug waveforms, and iterate autonomously. 24/7.

I didn't start this because I wanted to build a startup. I started this because I got tired of waiting for someone else to build what I needed.

CDAC — the team behind India's RISC-V processor — is already exploring it.

The design layer is the foundation. Everything else is downstream.

POSTING NOTES:
=====================================================================

1. TEXT-ONLY POST (no image, no carousel)
   - LinkedIn text posts with personal narrative get highest engagement
   - The contrast with yesterday's visual carousel keeps the feed varied
   - Text-only = LinkedIn gives more organic reach (no competing media)

2. STRUCTURE:
   - Opens with "10 years" — time = credibility
   - "70%" — the anchor number VCs will remember
   - Company names as social proof (Intel, ISRO, Axelera AI)
   - "Zero Indian companies" — the gap, the scarcity signal
   - "So I built ChipOS" — four words, the turn
   - CDAC validation — institutional proof
   - Closes with thesis: "The design layer is the foundation"

3. NO HASHTAGS on this post
   - Founder story posts perform better without hashtags on LinkedIn
   - Hashtags can make personal posts feel like marketing
   - Let the narrative speak

4. ENGAGEMENT:
   - This post will attract comments like "Congrats!" and "Inspiring"
   - Reply to EVERY comment with a thoughtful follow-up
   - Ask commenters what they're building or what their experience with EDA tools is
   - Turn comments into conversations

5. POSTING TIME: Tuesday 8-10 AM IST
