Note: Use the event context rather than a direct quote
(harder to verify exact quotes from a live keynote).
The 500,000+ viewer stat IS verifiable.

Why end with YOUR quote:
  - The carousel started with external authority (Modi, Lula, AI godfathers)
  - Ending with your voice puts you IN the conversation, not OUTSIDE it
  - The contrast between heads of state and a founder is the signal:
    "I belong in this conversation."

5 quotes from the India AI Summit 2026 that will define the next decade.

300,000 participants. 3,250+ speakers. 100+ countries. $250B+ committed.

These are the 5 moments I keep thinking about.

The full day-by-day breakdown is in the summit carousel (few posts back). Save that one too.

=====================================================================
POSTING NOTES:
=====================================================================

1. QUOTE CAROUSELS get extremely high save rates
   - People bookmark them for reference
   - Saves = highest-quality engagement signal

2. YOUR QUOTE AS THE CLOSER is the strategic move
   - It's not arrogance — you're adding your voice to the conversation
   - VCs seeing your name alongside Modi and Lula = credibility transfer
   - The quote itself ("$250B for compute. $0 for design") is the investment thesis

3. POST TIMING: Friday evening (7-8 PM IST)
   - Weekend content gets more saves (people browse leisurely)
   - Quote carousels are evergreen — they perform over days, not hours

4. STORY STRATEGY: Share each slide as a separate story
   - 5 stories = 5x the impression count
   - Add "See all 5" sticker on story 1
   - Add poll on story 5: "Which quote resonated most?"
